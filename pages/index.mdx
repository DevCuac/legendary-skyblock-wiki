> You can adjust the lightness independently for dark or light mode to increase
> legibility. E.g. to have a neutral primary color you can set the primary color
> to be white `HSL(0, 0%, 100%)` on dark theme and gray `HSL(0, 0%, 50%)` for
> light theme.

>     lightness: {
>       light: 50,
>       dark: 100
